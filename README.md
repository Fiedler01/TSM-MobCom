```

From **Android Studio** explore the cloned folders with the "file > open" menu, choose and open the **exercise folder** (the folder should have an **android icon**).

Wait for Android Studio to index the files (you will see a loading spinning wheel), update whatever this is required and follow the instructions.

Then you should be able to execute the exercise/demo on the emulator as well as on your physical smartphone.
